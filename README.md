# student-management
the next project i intend to work on is a student management software

anyways, since my java jdk is running, let me quickly setup my `mysql server`, and get `mysql workbench` (since i don't have any other DB GUI on my pc). i want to confirm my `Connector/J` (mysql jdbc driver for .jar file) is working, but then, i still have to even add the mysql jdbc driver to my classpath for it to work on my project.

well, quickly tried to run `mysql -u root -p` to see what's up but it wasn't running, but it did now sha.

For this project, what I want to do first is to:
- allow this software to add new students
